# Character design with Midjourney

## Prompt Details
with this prompt, you will be able to generate characters with Midjourney.

The example prompt will generate a character design sheet for a cartoonish Japanese Kappa character in robes, in the style of cartoon illustration and sketch, which is a unique and interesting way to bring to life this mythical creature from Japanese folklore. The cartoonish style gives a fun and playful feel to the character, while the robe adds an interesting layer to the traditional Kappa image.

â€“chaos parameter is a feature in the Midjourney image generation algorithm that controls how much more varied the results will be. It supports integer values on a scale from 0 to 100, with higher values favoring more interesting or unusual images. However, this also means that the results become less reliable in terms of composition. The chaos parameter is useful when exploring different interpretations of a prompt, but less so when trying to recreate a specific image composition. The parameter does not directly impact the creativity of the images, but rather the variety of the results.
